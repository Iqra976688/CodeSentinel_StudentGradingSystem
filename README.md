# Student Average & Grade Calculator (C++)

This is a simple C++ program that demonstrates the use of **arrays, loops, and basic logic**.  
It takes the number of students as input, then records each student's name and marks in 3 subjects.  
Finally, it calculates the **average marks** and assigns a grade (A, B, C, or Fail) to each student.
